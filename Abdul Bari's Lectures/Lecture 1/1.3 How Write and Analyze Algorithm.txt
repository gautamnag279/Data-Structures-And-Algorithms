> Algorithm to swap two numbers:
-------------------------------------
function swap(a, b):
    temp = a        = (1 unit)
    a = b           = (1 unit)
    b = temp        = (1 unit)               
               f(n) = 3 units of time

i.e 
    - the time complexity is a function of constant time
    - or in general it has O(1) time complexity
