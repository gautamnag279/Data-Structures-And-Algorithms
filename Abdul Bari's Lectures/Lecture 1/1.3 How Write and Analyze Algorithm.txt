> Algorithm to swap two numbers:
-------------------------------------
def swap(a, b):
    temp = a        = (1 unit)
    a = b           = (1 unit)
    b = temp        = (1 unit)               
               f(n) = 3 units of time

i.e 
    - the time complexity is a function of constant time = O(3)
    - which is depicted as O(1)
